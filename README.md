# Visualization of basic operation on Signals & Systems using MATLAB GUI
Using MATLAB GUI, I've made a standalone executable software to calculate & plot to visualize different basic operations on signals:
o Matrix manipulation; Plotting of triangular, rectangular, sawtooth wave from given equation.
o Shifting, Scaling & Reversal of Periodic (Continuous & Discrete) Signals; Fourier Series visualization; Square wave formation & associated Gibbs phenomenon.
o Shifting, Scaling & Reversal of Delta, Unit step, Ramp & Aperiodic Signals
o Fourier Transform
o Sampling, Aliasing & Convolution
o Group Formation with Randomly Selected Roll Numbers:
Additionally I've included code to create randomly sorted group from given roll number list (user given input or Excel sheet input); among the input roll range 'only odd'/'only even'/'all roll' can be used to form a group of random rolls where input Excel file's roll numbers can be of ascending/descending/random order & save the output in a new sheet of an Excel file having the date-time of data formation.

Also, I've done little audio processing where the program plays randomly selected audio among 3 audio source files & can be muted using the audio mute button.
