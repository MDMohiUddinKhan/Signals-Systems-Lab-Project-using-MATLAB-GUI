# Signals-Systems-Lab-Project-using-MATLAB-GUI

Using MATLAB GUI, I've made a standalone executable software accumulating all the lab assignments.

Additionally I've included code to create randomly sorted group from given roll number list (user given input or Excel sheet input); among the input roll range 'only odd'/'only even'/'all roll' can be used to form a group of random rolls where input Excel file's roll numbers can be of ascending/descending/random order & save the output in a new sheet of an Excel file having the date-time of data formation.

Also, I've done little audio processing where the program plays randomly selected audio among 3 audio source files & can be muted using the audio mute button.
